                    <p>LeetCode is a coding and programming interview practice tool that helps beginners and
                        professionals prepare for careers in technology. You can leetcode with any programming language.
                        However, I don't recommend languages other than Python and Java for two reasons. First, the
                        available resources are relatively scarce, so finding a solution in different languages can be
                        challenging. Some major companies rely on LeetCode or similar platforms to test applicants’
                        coding skills. However, students and professionals also use the platform to work with peers and
                        expand their technical skills. </p>

                    <p>CodeChef is an online educational and competitive programming platform.CodeChef was created as a
                        platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming, and
                        programming contests. It hosts three featured contests every month (Long Challenge, CookOff,
                        LunchTime & Starters) and gives away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement.
                        CodeChef started as an educational initiative in 2009 by Directi, an Indian software company. In
